# udacity-project1

This is a Data Science project for the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project, we dive in the Boston AirBnb Dataset, in order to answer 3 business questions:

1. What was the housestay that earned the most? Is it in the most expensive street? 
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston? By how much do prices spike?
3. Is it possible to predict the prices using the other informations?

The dataset covers the AirBnb listings from September/2016 till September/2017, and is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).

We answer these questions by using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, following the CRISP-DM methodology. Enjoy the insights!
