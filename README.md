Data Science project on the Boston AirBNB Dataset. We focus on answering 3 business questions:

1. What was the housestay that earned the most? Is it in the most expensive street? 
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
3. Is it possible to predict the prices using the other informations?

We answer these questions by using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.
